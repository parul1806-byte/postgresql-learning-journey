# postgresql-learning-journey
This repository contains my structured PostgreSQL practice using pgAdmin 4. It covers table creation, data insertion, filtering, sorting, joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and real-world query problems. All SQL scripts are organized by topic for revision, learning, and showcasing SQL proficiency.
This repository contains my complete PostgreSQL practice using pgAdmin 4.

It includes:

- ‚úÖ Table creation using `CREATE TABLE`, constraints, data types
- ‚úÖ Insertion of sample data using `INSERT INTO`
- ‚úÖ SELECT queries with filters (`WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ JOIN operations: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`
- ‚úÖ Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- ‚úÖ Subqueries and nested queries
- ‚úÖ Sorting, limiting results (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`)
- ‚úÖ Use of aliases, string/date functions, and arithmetic operations
- ‚úÖ Real-world query challenges and interview-style problems
- ‚úÖ Organized `.sql` files for different topics and chapters
# SQL Practice ‚Äì CRUD & Constraints

This file contains a list of SQL practice tasks covering CRUD operations, ALTER TABLE usage, and constraints handling.
