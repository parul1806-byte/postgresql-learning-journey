# postgresql-learning-journey
This repository contains my structured PostgreSQL practice using pgAdmin 4. It covers table creation, data insertion, filtering, sorting, joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and real-world query problems. All SQL scripts are organized by topic for revision, learning, and showcasing SQL proficiency.
This repository contains my complete PostgreSQL practice using pgAdmin 4.

It includes:

- ✅ Table creation using `CREATE TABLE`, constraints, data types
- ✅ Insertion of sample data using `INSERT INTO`
- ✅ SELECT queries with filters (`WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, etc.)
- ✅ JOIN operations: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`
- ✅ Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- ✅ Subqueries and nested queries
- ✅ Sorting, limiting results (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`)
- ✅ Use of aliases, string/date functions, and arithmetic operations
- ✅ Real-world query challenges and interview-style problems
- ✅ Organized `.sql` files for different topics and chapters

All queries were written and tested in **pgAdmin 4**, and exported here to track my learning progress, revision, and GitHub portfolio.
