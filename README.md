# postgresql-learning-journey
This repository contains my structured PostgreSQL practice using pgAdmin 4. It covers table creation, data insertion, filtering, sorting, joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and real-world query problems. All SQL scripts are organized by topic for revision, learning, and showcasing SQL proficiency.
